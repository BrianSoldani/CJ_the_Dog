            <p>We rescued CJ in 2005. He was a stray that had been hit by a car and was sent to a high kill rate shelter, meaning he was slated to be put down very quickly. He had such a great attitude that the manager of that shelter couldn't bear to put him down so quickly. We found him with minutes to spare and quickly adopted him. He's been with u ever since.
